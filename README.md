# Linear-Chain-Conditional-Random-Fields

Contains the implementation of a linear chain Conditional Random Fields model using the template from the great Machine Learning lectures of Hugo Larochelle. 

The CRF has a context window size of radius 1. 

The learning involves the computation of alpha and beta tables via forward-backward dynamic programming algorithm. The correctness of the learning algorithm can be verified by running the run_verify_gradients.py script.
